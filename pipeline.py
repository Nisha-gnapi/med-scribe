You are given two aligned ASR outputs (Whisper and MedASR).
 
For every aligned token or phrase:
 
1. Compare Whisper and MedASR.

2. Select the more accurate transcription.

3. If both are incorrect, infer the intended utterance using surrounding context.

4. Preserve timestamps and speakers.

5. Merge corrected words into fluent, punctuated sentences.

6. Produce the corrected transcript.

7. Produce a concise speaker-aware clinical summary.

8. Additionally, produce a plain-text clinical summary using the 4-section format defined below.
 
Rules
 
* Preserve all medical terminology.

* Preserve medications.

* Preserve negations.

* Preserve diagnoses.

* Preserve family history.

* Preserve treatment plans.

* Preserve temporal information.

* Never invent medical facts.

* Never omit any spoken content.

* Never duplicate any spoken content.

* Every aligned token must appear exactly once in the corrected transcript.

* Do not merge adjacent words together. Preserve proper spacing between all words.

* Do not split a single word into multiple words unless correcting an obvious ASR error.

* Do not combine two consecutive words into one word.

* Preserve chronological order.

* Preserve speaker boundaries. Never merge utterances from different speakers.

* Do not create overlapping transcript segments.

* Every transcript segment must represent one continuous spoken utterance.

* The start timestamp must equal the first token's start time in the segment.

* The end timestamp must equal the last token's end time in the segment.

* Duration must equal end minus start.

* Apply normal English punctuation and capitalization.

* Expand abbreviations only if they are unambiguous in medical context.

* Normalize obvious ASR spelling errors (e.g., "pane" → "pain", "amoxycillin" → "amoxicillin").

* Prefer the medically correct term when Whisper and MedASR disagree.

* Preserve medication dosages and units exactly.

* Preserve numbers and measurements accurately.

* If one ASR output contains additional correct words that are missing from the other, retain them.

* Do not hallucinate medications, diagnoses, symptoms, or findings.
 
Transcript Segmentation Rules
 
* Consecutive tokens spoken by the same speaker MUST be merged into a single transcript segment whenever they belong to the same continuous utterance.

* Do NOT create one transcript entry per token.

* Build complete spoken sentences or clauses for each speaker.

* A new transcript segment should only begin when:

  - the speaker changes,

  - there is a significant pause between utterances,

  - or a clearly new utterance begins.

* For every merged segment:

  - start = start timestamp of the first token in the segment.

  - end = end timestamp of the last token in the segment.

  - duration = end - start.

  - text = all corrected words joined together with proper spacing, punctuation and capitalization.

* Preserve the chronological order of speech.

* Never merge speech from different speakers.

* Never create overlapping transcript segments.

* Every token from the input must appear exactly once in exactly one transcript segment.
 
Summary Rules
 
* Summarize only information present in the corrected transcript.

* Do not infer diagnoses or treatment decisions.

* Group findings into clinically appropriate categories.

* Preserve negations (e.g., "denies chest pain").

* Preserve speaker attribution.
 
Additional Clinical Summary Rules (for the new plain-text summary only)
 
* This is an EXTRA output field. It does not replace or alter the existing "summary" array above.

* Summarize only information present in the corrected transcript.

* Do not infer diagnoses or treatment decisions that were not explicitly stated.

* Do not invent or fabricate any field. If information for a field was not mentioned in the transcript, write "Not mentioned" for that field.

* Preserve negations, medication names, dosages, units, family history, and temporal information exactly as stated.

* Format this summary as plain text (not JSON), using the following 4-section structure:
 
Clinical Summary
 
1. Patient Information

- Name:

- Age/Gender:

- Date of Visit:

- Chief Complaint:
 
2. Clinical Findings

- Procedures (if performed):

- Follow-up:

- Patient Education and Recommendations:
 
Return ONLY valid JSON.
